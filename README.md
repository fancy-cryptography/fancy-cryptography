# Fancy cryptography in the wild ðŸŽ©

Curated list of deployments of *fancy* cryptography.

Cryptography counts as fancy if it uses primitives beyond symmetric ciphers,
(EC)DH as key agreement, digital signatures, public key encryption such as
RSA-OAEP, or KEMs, or uses those
primitives in unusual ways, especially if it relies on properties beyond IND-CCA2.

A secondary goal of this list is to provide cryptographers with a list
of schemes that still need to be upgraded to post-quantum cryptography.
